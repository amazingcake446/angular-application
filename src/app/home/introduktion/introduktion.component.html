            The architecture of an Angular application relies on certain fundamental concepts.
            The basic building blocks of the Angular framework are Angular components that are organized into NgModules.
            NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules.
            An app always has at least a root module that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature
            modules.</p>
