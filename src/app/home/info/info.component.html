        <p class="lead home-p text-danger">What is Directives?</p>
        <p class="text-white">There are three kinds of directives in Angular:</p>
        <p class="text-white"> 1.Components—directives with a template.</p>
        <p class="text-white"> 2.Structural directives—change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements.</p>
        <p class="text-white"> 3.Attribute directives—change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.</p>
        <p class="text-white">So now we're going to cover directive's again, it's another fundamental.
          Of angular, so an angular directives are used to manipulate dom objects using angular directives,
          we can change the appearance, the behavior or even the layout of a dom object.
          <p class="text-white">
            So directives are basically instructions inside the dom.
            Directives are classified under three different headings, according to how they behave.
            Component directive's structural directives and attribute directives.

      <div class="Binding p-1 m-2">
        <h1 class="display-4 fw-normal text-danger p-5">Binding</h1>
        <p class="lead home-p text-danger">What Is Bindings?</p>
        <p class="text-white">There are diffrent types of binding in Angular:</p>
        <p class="text-white"> Property Binding, - Class Binding, - Style Binding, - Event Binding, - Two way binding, - Pipes.</p>
        <p class="text-white">Binding is the process which forms the connection between the application UI and the data which comes from the business logic. In Angular, it can be called the automatic synchronization of the data and the view.</p>

      <div class="Sevice p-1 m-2">
        <h1 class="display-4 fw-normal text-danger p-5">Service</h1>
        <p class="lead home-p text-danger">What Is Services?</p>
        <p class="text-white">AngularJS services are substitutable objects that are wired together using dependency injection (DI). You can use services to organize and share code across your app.</p>
        <p class="text-white">AngularJS services are:</p>
        <p class="text-white">Lazily instantiated – AngularJS only instantiates a service when an application component depends on it.
          Singletons – Each component dependent on a service gets a reference to the single instance generated by the service factory</p>
        <p class="text-white">Using a Service</p>
        <p class="text-white">To use an AngularJS service, you add it as a dependency for the component (controller, service, filter or directive) that depends on the service. AngularJS's dependency injection subsystem takes care of the rest.</p>

      <div class="Route p-1 m-2">
        <h1 class="display-4 fw-normal text-danger p-5">Route</h1>
        <p class="lead home-p text-danger">What Is Routing?</p>
        <p class="text-white">Routing in Angular helps us navigate from one view to another as users perform tasks in web apps. In this guide you will learn about Angular router's primary features.</p>
        <p class="text-white"> Angular router can interpret a browser URL as an instruction to navigate to a client-generated view. It can pass optional parameters along to the supporting view component that help it decide what specific content to present. You can bind the router to links on a page, and it will navigate to the appropriate application view when the user clicks a link.</p>
        <p class="lead home-p text-danger">How To Generate An App With Routing Enabled?</p>
        <p class="text-white">The following command uses the Angular CLI to generate a basic Angular app with an app routing module, called AppRoutingModule, which is an NgModule where you can configure your routes. The app name in the following example is routing-app.</p>
        <p class="text-success"> >ng new routing-app --routing</p>
        <p class="lead home-p text-danger">How To Add Components For Routing?</p>
        <p class="text-white">To use the Angular router, an app needs to have at least two components so that it can navigate from one to the other. To create a component using the CLI, enter the following at the command line where first is the name of your component:</p>
        <p class="text-success"> >ng generate component first</p>
